# EnderTranslate

A text packet translation minecraft plugin  
Translates your minecraft in multiple languages, and allows players to choose their language with a gui or command

The plugin can be used on a simple spigot, but supports bungeecord and velocity  

If you use the plugin with a proxy, the packet translation will be done on the proxy,
so it will have zero performance costs on the spigot servers

The plugin has a web editor made in React and hosted with GitHub pages
On this repo you have the full code base with java + web React

You can modify the plugin, and contribute to it on GitHub if you want  

If you use the plugin on a server with players, please buy it on spigot, or bbb  
**No support will be provided to non-buyer**

This plugin uses **[PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents)**
